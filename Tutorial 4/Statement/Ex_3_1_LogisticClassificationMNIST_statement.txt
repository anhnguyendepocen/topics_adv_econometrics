% The goal of this exercise is creating a handwriting recognition
% for a data set that contains handwritten digits between zero and nine 
% using a one-vs-all logistic classifier.
% The handwritten digits are characterized by a 20 x 20 pixel gray level
% matrix that is stored in the lines of the file digits_data.csv. The label
% corresponding to each digit is stored in digits_labels.csv; the digit "0"
% is mapped to label "10" in this list.

% 1.- Read the data out of the files 'digits_data.csv' and 'digits_labels.csv' 
% and create a design matrix X
% in which the rows contain the pixel gray levels of each image. Each row
% should contain 400 values. Create also a vector y containing the labels
% associated to each picture

% 2.- Create a function [h, display_array] = displayData(X, example_width)
% % that displays 2D data in a grid out of the design matrix X that you 
% constructed. It returns the figure handle h and the displayed array if requested.
% Use this function to display 100 randomly chosen figures in the data set.

% 3.- Construct a logistic classifier to find the "1"s in the dataset using 
% the built-in matlab (glmfit) function. Compute the Type I,
% Type II, and empirical errors.

% 4.- One-vs-all logistic regression. Construct a one-vs-all logistic
% classifier for the 10 figures. Compute the Type I, Type II, and empirical errors.

% 5.- Create a misclassification matrix whose (i,j)th element
% denotes the percentage of times in which the classifier assigns the 
% figure with label i the label j.

% 6.- Use the function displayData in point 2 in order to visualize the 
% "7"s that get classified as a "9".
